    <div class="aboutMe">    
            <p> My name is, Cameron Godbold, at the moment I am 19 years old. I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/">Florida Gulf Coast University</a> in my Sophomore year here. Here I am studying software engineering as my primary major. In the past I have always wanted to do something with computers and creating new programs and applications for people to find joy in. So I felt right at home with software engineering. Back in high school was when I had become certified in many programs that would aid me in furthering my knowledge of the field.

<p class="imgText">In one and of the projects we did for my computer science course, we had to take an audio file and edit it. For my project, I took one of my favorite songs and took out a fairly large part of the song that I didn't particularly like and lowered the bass and increased the treble and volume of the song. The song is L'indecis - Soulful. </p>

<p class="imgText">In our computer science class we were asked to create a canvas element. A canvas element is used to draw graphics on a webpage. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text. </p>
    <div class="contentWrapper">
        <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:5px solid #d3d3d3;"> </canvas>
        <script>
        var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
        var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
        ctx.font = "30px Arial";
        ctx.strokeText("Hello There",10,50);

<p class="imgText"> In our computer science class we were asked to make an svg image. An svg is a "Scalable Vector Graphic". These types of images are useful when you're using it on things on varying sizes due to the fact that the resolution of the picture will not change depending on the scale of the image. </p>

<p class="imgText">In my free time one of my favorite things to do is play video games with my friends. One of our most played and favorite games, is League of Legends. I've been playing this game for 5 years now and still play with friends from the day I started with. Here's a video on some of the basics of the game. </p>
