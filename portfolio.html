            <p> My name is, Cameron Godbold, at the moment I am 19 years old. 
            I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.fgcu.edu/">Florida Gulf Coast University</a> in my Sophomore year here. Here I am studying software engineering as my primary major. In the past I have always wanted to do something with computers and creating new programs and applications for people to find joy in. So I felt right at home with software engineering. Back in high school was when I had become certified in many programs that would aid me in furthering my knowledge of the field.
